            I'm Danielle, and currently a senior at Michigan State University.
            I'm majoring in computer science with a cognate in media and information,
            and minoring in graphic design.
            I currently work as a Graphic Designer for the College of Engineering K-12 Outreach Office at MSU, 
            and recently took an internship as a Product Designer at Ford Motor Company for the summer. Both of these experiences as well as the
            classes I'm taking are really helping me to find my passion in design. Some of my current interests 
            include Web Design, Front End Web Development, Product Design, and UX/UI Design.
